**cli-weather** allows you to check the weather without taking a step outside your development environment. Instant,
accurate location-based current conditions + four-day forecast.

### Download

### Updates
**cli-weather** has received a bit of a facelift! More colors have been added, different symbols, and a better packaging
system have been implemented. This project is going to be expanded in the near future (hint hint), so there's always room
for added features.
